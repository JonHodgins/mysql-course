<p><strong>Why Learn MySQL</strong></p>



<p>Consistently ranked the most in-demand skill in recent employer surveys, SQL is a fantastic way to increase your income and boost your professional development. So many companies today use MySQL, including Twitter, Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Github, Kickstarter, Udemy, Slack, and many others. <strong>Unsure about the difference between SQL and MySQL?</strong> MySQL is the most popular open source SQL database out there, so it’s a great choice to begin your learning journey. We’ll talk a lot more about the difference between SQL and MySQL in the course, but 95% of what you learn about MySQL in this course will apply to other databases such as Postgres, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.</p>



<p><strong>Why This Course Is Different &nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>This isn’t going to be a course where you watch me code for 20 hours; it’s a course with <strong>ample opportunity for you to get your hands dirty writing code</strong> (even within the first 7 minutes of the course).</p>



<p>My teaching experience is rooted in the classroom. I’ve spent years teaching programming, web development, and databases to my in-person bootcamp students. This course combines the best of my offline courses with the convenience of learning online, in a setting that’s best for you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upon completing this course, you’ll be able to interact with and query any SQL database out there. You’ll also be able to generate reports with ease, answer company performance questions using data, and integrate MySQL into complete applications.</p>
